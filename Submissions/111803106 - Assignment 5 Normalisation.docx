## Database Normalisation Analysis for Meditrack System

### 1. Introduction
This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the database normalisation process for the Meditrack Hospital Management System. The normalisation process ensures data integrity, reduces redundancy, and improves database performance.

### 2. Original Unnormalised Design
The initial database design contained several issues:
- Redundant data storage
- Update anomalies
- Insertion anomalies
- Deletion anomalies

### 3. First Normal Form (1NF)
**Requirements:** All attributes must contain atomic values
**Applied to tables:**
- patients
- doctors
- appointments
- medical_history
- diagnoses
- doctor_schedules

### 4. Second Normal Form (2NF)
**Requirements:** Must be in 1NF and all non-key attributes must be fully functionally dependent on the primary key
**Analysis:**
- All tables satisfy 2NF requirements
- No partial dependencies found

### 5. Third Normal Form (3NF)
**Requirements:** Must be in 2NF and no transitive dependencies
**Analysis:**
- All tables satisfy 3NF requirements
- No transitive dependencies identified

### 6. Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)
**Requirements:** Must be in 3NF and every determinant must be a superkey
**Analysis:**
- All tables satisfy BCNF requirements

### 7. Conclusion
The Meditrack database schema is properly normalised up to BCNF, ensuring optimal data storage and integrity.
